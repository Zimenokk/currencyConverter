#**Website to check the exchange rate.**
###On the site you can see the rate of **62** currency pairs, which provides the API of the national bank of my country.
Conversion takes place in both directions (when you change the first instance - changes the second, when you change the second instance - changes the first).

For the site I have created a user-friendly interface, which I have developed.

The project uses: `React`, `Redux-toolkit`, `Axios`, `SCSS`,
